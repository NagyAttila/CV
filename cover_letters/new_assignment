Hey!

I have a relatively mixed background in hardware and software that goes back to my University years. My Bachelor was in Electrical Engineering in Budapest, Hungary, while my Master was in Computer Science on Chalmers in Gothenburg, Sweden. Furthermore, I had the chance to work on applications that are a mix of these two worlds. For instance, I was involved in Volvo's Autonomous Drive project for 2 years using Matlab, Python and C++, and later in another project I built adaptive spoilers for Volvo Trucks at a small startup using Machine Learning, Matlab, Python and C. Both of these projects were resource critical, real-time applications in an embedded environment. Currently, I am working in Telecommunication at Ericsson on PacketCore using C++. All together, I have 5 years work experience in C++ on bigger projects, and 4 years experience in Embedded Systems on rather smaller projects where my role was algorithm and design oriented. Testing was always part of my role and currently I am part of a cross-functional team where we focus on sharing roles and avoiding working in silos. Linux is my native work environment since my teenager years (10+ years).
