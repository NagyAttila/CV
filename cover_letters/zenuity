Hi!

I was deeply impressed by seeing your opening job positions at your page. Many of my former colleagues from Volvo Cars, now working at Zenuity's AD team, recommended me to look it up since they thought it is inline with my current line of interest and studies. And indeed, on my first few seconds of skimming through your open positions, Deep Learning caught my eyes.

Since I left Volvo Cars, July, 2016, I was investing a significant part of my time into my new hobby, a.k.a. Deep Learning. Driven by this, in January, 2017, I applied for Udacity's first Nanodegree program focusing solely on this field. Unfortunately, this program will end in a month, and therefore it is time for me to seek out new opportunities which are preferably in a strong correlation with my current course of studies. This is in fact the very reason why I am hereby sending you my application for your open Deep Learning Engineer position.

Please be aware that this application displays my LinkedIn profile in an excruciatingly simple form lacking any sort of indentation. In case you would like to enjoy my profile in its full beauty, please follow this link below:

Furthermore, in case you wonder whom you should contact to gain some information about my former activities at Volvo Cars, I would recommend you the following Zenuity employees and my ex-colleagues:
  • Joakim Lin-Sörstedt, my former manager,
  • Daniel Svensson, the senior algorithm designer from my former team, and
  • Niklas Carlson, a fellow developer from my former team.

Best regards and all the goodies,
Attila Nagy.
