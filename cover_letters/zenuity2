Hi!

I used to work for Volvo Cars on Active-Safety between 2014 and 2016 as a consult, and currently looking for new opportunities. A few years ago  I finished a nanodegree program on Udacity in Deep Learning and work with Machine Learning in the last 2 years.

I used to work with the following Zenuity employees on a daily basis:
  • Joakim Lin-Sörstedt, my former manager,
  • Daniel Svensson, the senior algorithm designer from my former team, and
  • Niklas Carlsson, a fellow developer from my former team,
  • Carlos Gálvez, another fellow developer.

Best Regards,
Attila Nagy.
