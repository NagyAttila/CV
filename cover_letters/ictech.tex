I got a tip, from a former colleague of mine from Volvo Cars who is currently working for Zenuity, that if I am planning to work for Zenuity as a consult, I should contact Ictech.

The end of last year I finished at my previous job and decided to try myself out as a self-employed freelancer and currently looking for my first assignment. I used to work with Active-Safety at Volvo Cars in the Autonomous Drive project and since I already have some friends from old times working there, it feels like a good start. My hope is that Ictech can help me with finding my first assignment at Zenuity.

Furthermore, in case you wonder whom you should contact to gain some information about my former activities at Volvo Cars, I would recommend you the following Zenuity employees and my ex-colleagues:

\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
    \item Joakim Lin-SÃ¶rstedt, my former manager,
    \item Daniel Svensson, the senior algorithm designer from my former team,
    \item Niklas Carlson, a fellow developer.
\end{itemize}
