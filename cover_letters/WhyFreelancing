I was working in the corporate world for 5 years and never really felt that it was meant for me. Passion is an important part of my life and no matter what I do I either create passion for it or I stop doing it. It is really hard to match passion with the current corporate work system, since the main focus is always on the number of hours that a person spends on work and not the quality or the devotion for it. Therefore, it was always hard for me to work exactly 8 hours per day and not 12 when there was a lot to do or 6 when there was nothing to do at all. As a free lancer, I have the impression, that I can work in flexible time on shorter projects, and later focus solely on travelling, slacklining, climbing, acroyoga and meditation between projects. I believe that a constant full-time job has a negative effect on the body and soul, and therefore I see myself working in periods in the future as it used to be before the industrial revolution. That time people had hard times working intensely on the fields for certain seasons and then after harvest they had a longer period of rest. I would like to go back to these days and have a kind of job where I can have a period when I focus only on my job, working intensely, followed by another period when I spend all my time on things that I am also passionate about. I want to get back the power over my life and freelancing seems to be the best way to do that.
