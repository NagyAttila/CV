Recently I quit my job to move to Bali and try out the digital-nomad life-style with a friend. For this reason, currently I have approximately 40 hours per week for online- and self-study; such as Udacity, and finally reading books that I was for such a long time longing for; e.g. Douglas R. Hofstadter's GÃ¶del Escher Bach: en Eternal Golden Braid. Yeay! However, in the last few weeks I got really into the habit of learning on your platform and, since I am almost done with the Machine Learning course, I started to think about having a deeper knowledge in this field. At my previous job, Volvo Cars, Sweden, I have already had the chance to obtain some practical knowledge in this field as a Self-Driving Car Engineer, but with your Nanodegree program my purpose is to gain further understanding in Artificial Intelligence and Deep Learning as well mainly focusing on their theoretical background. Therefore, hereby I am applying for your Nanodegree in the field of Artificial Intelligence.
